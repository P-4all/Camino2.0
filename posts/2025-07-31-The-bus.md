# The Bus

## Thursday 31 July – 20:58

Well then, here we are again to recount the fortunes and misfortunes of this endearing character. Full of excitement and uncertainty about starting the stages of the Camino Francés from St Jean Pied de Port to León. “El Camino 2.0”.

It is still 20:58, and I am in the “Safestay Elephant and Castle” hostel in London. Today has passed without much to report. I got up at my place in Falmouth at around 7 a.m. I made a few changes to my backpack, although the headphones I took, thinking they were lighter, did not work. Also, while I was waiting for the bus, I realised I had forgotten my Spanish mobile phone. Anyway, on the way to the bus stop, I stopped at the Co-op to buy breakfast and lunch (various bits of junk food).

The bus journey was very long; up to the stop in Plymouth,h everything was fine. There, many people got on, including some old rockers and a family with many children, one of whom had special needs. I coped fairly well, and I admire that mother’s patience and love, because in the last hours of the journey, the children were getting completely out of hand. The one sitting next to me wouldn’t stop playing videos on his phone out loud; the child with special needs couldn’t be understood at all and wouldn’t stop talking; only the mother understood him. At the end of the journey, the woman apologised to some passengers who were in the queue to get off. Anyway, my right foot blister — which I got while training in Falmouth (better now than later) — was aching a little. It already seems to be healing.

To make the time pass more quickly and to ease my own suffering, as well as that of the passengers and everyone in general, I started reciting mantras and, almost without realising it, I entered a state in which nothing that was happening around me bothered me at all. With the mala, I managed about 10 rounds in the first session up to the service area, and about 15 more in the second.

When I arrived at Victoria Station, only a few of us got off, and I started walking to where I am now. As I walked, I was thinking about the reason for Camino 2.0, since the first one was a kind of search for myself and became the launchpad for my future wanderings. Now it is the same, but from another perspective: walking in order to dismantle myself. To discover that the essence of all beings is the same — when you do something to someone else, you are doing it to yourself in another form.

There have been three or four actions that I take joy in, and dedicate the merits:

1. While waiting for the bus, I picked up a woman’s glasses.
2. When getting off the bus, I picked up rubbish that wasn’t mine (it belonged to my other self).
3. I gave directions to a couple who asked me how to get to Victoria Station.
4. I cleaned the public toilet after using it so that the next user — myself in another form — would feel more comfortable.

I’ve also been chatting with Edna, who is in a very beautiful stage of her life, hoping to become a mum, and well, I think that’s enough for today. How great it feels to be writing again.
