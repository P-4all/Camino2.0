It’s 11:31 p.m., and I’m already back in my hostel bed, showered and clean, ready to write a bit about today.
I woke up around 4 with a slight gumache; I took the opportunity to go to the bathroom, then went back to sleep. Around 8 am, my roommates started waking up. By the way, one of them snored terribly, but since I didn’t have my earplugs handy, I just had to put up with it. After people left, there was only one guy left in the room, who, I guess, had been out all night.

I went down for breakfast around 9 am, and there was no hot food left. I made myself a tea, a wholewheat toast with baked beans and butter—very English—and a yoghurt with oat flakes. I was still hungry, so I grabbed another toast with cheese.
All that for £8. Tomorrow I think I’ll have brunch outside the hostel.

When I left, I stopped by Co-op and bought some water and a banana. Before heading out, I didn’t really have a clear plan, so I started reading the guide the tour people gave me. I considered options like Tutu's Food Market recommendation, museums, and shows… In the end, I decided to go see the bookshop from the movie Notting Hill. (I know, so random.)
**That shows how important it is to set a goal; it doesn’t matter what it is, but you need one to start moving. Without a goal or destination, there’s no path, no direction, no movement.**

Once the destination was set, I had the route with the help of GPS—although I didn’t really pay much attention to it. I started walking and passed a street full of Latin American food stalls (it would be nice to try them). Then I went under a tunnel full of incredibly well-done graffiti, and there were already lots of people around. I continued towards the river, planning to cross the Big Ben bridge.
I took a photo of the House of Lords and was struck by the wall full of hearts with the names of COVID victims.

Among the graffiti, there was another very meaningful one that said:

> “Everything I lose creates space for everything I need,” said Pooh.
>
> “That’s deep,” said Piglet.
>
> “You found Rizlas… porky?” said Pooh.

Anyway, letting go is super important so that something new can take its place.

But after crossing the bridge, I urgently needed to use the bathroom. I found one easily in one of those chain restaurants. I reached Hyde Park and was amazed at how big it is—I crossed almost all of it, walked by the lake, and just before leaving, I was already hungry. I asked Laura about a Japanese place, and it turned out there was one at Notting Hill Gate, so I ate there, absolutely delicious.

I walked along the street because there was a market. Then I crossed almost all of London following Oxford Street. My foot started hurting again, so I stopped to look for a bathroom and went into a building like El Corte Inglés, but even posher: Selfridges. I was amazed by the number of posh people there. A bit further on, I stopped to check my foot, and there happened to be a group of people reciting the Quran for healing. I kept going until I reached Tower Hill, where the tour started.

The story of the five murdered women was super interesting. I think I’m going to have nightmares. Along the way, I gave a coin to someone; there were lots of people holding signs saying they were hungry, and I saw one with a burger. I thought about giving food to the next homeless person I saw with a sign, but I didn’t come across anyone else.

When the tour ended, I found a massage place, which was just what I needed since my legs were extremely tired and my back was very stiff. On the way, I bought some headphones. And now I’m going to sleep because it’s late. Tomorrow I’ll take things very easy.
Good night.
