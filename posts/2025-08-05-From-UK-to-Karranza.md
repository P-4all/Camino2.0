# From UK to Karranza

It’s 16:25. I’m in the Karranza Valley, at a spa resort which I think is called Paloti or something like that. I’m super happy and grateful to be here. I didn’t write yesterday, even though I had time at Bilbao Airport. I didn’t do it because I thought there had to be a specific moment, before going to sleep, to reflect on the day and all that. But this morning, here at the festival, there are all sorts of people, and I saw a girl who was writing. She inspired me to write whenever I feel I need to, since writing helps me organise my ideas and thoughts, and understand what I want or need. Anyway, I’m going to try to summarise yesterday.

Nothing exceptional really happened. I woke up, packed my rucksack and went to catch the train to the airport. First the Underground from Elephant and Castle, and then at London Bridge I took the first train to Gatwick. I arrived about three hours early; the journey lasted roughly an hour, and I used the time to meditate.

At the airport, I went through security slightly worried because I was carrying nail scissors and some biotin vitamins in a cardboard box, but in the end I was lucky and they didn’t search my rucksack.

I went for breakfast at a place whose name I can’t remember and ordered a Moroccan breakfast — absolutely delicious. Afterwards, while checking my email, I saw that the university had sent me a message listing all the benefits and discounts I had. So I looked around the airport shops to see where I could make use of them. I found that I could get a discount at WHSmith. After paying £20 for a discount voucher, and not really knowing how to redeem it — nor did the assistant — I think I ended up getting three bottles of water for free and two very interesting books: one about Ikigai and the other entitled Don’t Believe Everything You Think. Both are very much aligned with the same way of thinking as the Apapacho Fest.

On the plane, I read almost half of one book, and at Bilbao Airport, I nearly finished it. After waiting almost three hours, I found the bus, on which only four people got on: a Basque man called Jaime; a girl, Evelina; a Catalan woman, Marta; and another girl who arrived later and about whom I know very little — well, actually, I do know she’s volunteering and learning tarot.

At Bilbao bus station, the rest of the group got on. There were about 14 or 15 of us. We headed towards the coast, entered Cantabria and then went back into the Basque Country to avoid a very winding road.

This place is wonderful — so much greenery and freshness. At night, it’s about 15 degrees with one hundred per cent humidity; I touched the tent, and it was wet. During the day, it’s warmer in the sun, but in the shade, with the breeze, it’s very pleasant.

Let’s focus on the festival. When I arrived, there were already loads of people, but I was among the first to register. They put a wristband on me and gave me a welcoming hug — an apapacho. Here, everyone gives each other apapachos. In fact, right in front of me, there are two people hugging now. There’s a really lovely energy and all sorts of people here, with different motivations and intentions. Some make jokes about this whole spiritual scene; others seem quite advanced on their path. You can also see people who’ve come to find out what all this is about, not really knowing where they are or what they’ll discover — and others who’ve come simply hoping to hook up. People are very keen!
