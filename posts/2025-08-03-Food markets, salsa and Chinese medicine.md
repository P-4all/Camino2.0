# Food markets, salsa and Chinese medicine

## Sunday 3rd August

Today could be described as a very good day. As always, it’s 11:26 p.m.; I’m in my hostel bed, already showered, with my clothes washed, and ready to reflect on today.

I woke up with a bit of pain in my lower abdomen and my back. I was a little worried about it and thought it might be due to my diet and not having had a bowel movement. So I decided to go to Co-op and buy a ready-made porridge that only needs hot water, along with a banana. When I went to ask for hot water at the hostel, there was no one at the bar; the receptionist was very busy, so I went over to the area where breakfast had been served a few minutes earlier. I found a guy cleaning and asked him for hot water. He told me to ask the receptionist, and I said she was very busy. He replied, “Well, so am I.”

I didn’t insist anymore and went to wait at the bar. Shortly after, a girl came and gave me hot water.

While I was having breakfast, there was a huge group of people wearing blue polo shirts—it must have been for something—people of all ages and very diverse. There was one guy who wouldn’t stop smoking and had dentures: he kept taking them out and putting them back in. Disgusting!

While eating breakfast, I decided to visit Borough Market, which is only a 20-minute walk away. I went there, and there were tons of people queuing for everything: paella, strawberries with chocolate, and so on. It was super expensive and very tourist-oriented. So I decided to keep walking to London Fields Market. I found it after walking for an hour; I passed by Sushi Samba on Bishopsgate Street and went through Liverpool Street, where everyone was carrying plants (very curious).

When I arrived, I was pleasantly surprised: there were people, but it wasn’t overcrowded. After walking through it from top to bottom, I decided to eat at a pizzeria. It sat really well with me, and for dessert I had a honey and ginger ice cream, which I ate on the way to the park. In the park there was an area where people were training calisthenics—very lean and muscular. I found a place to sit and meditate, right in front of a cricket field where they were playing. I had never seen a cricket match before; everyone was dressed in white.

After that, I did a few stretches for my back, took the train with the aim of going to a bar to dance bachata. I got off at Liverpool Street and from there took the red line and stopped at Tottenham Court Road. From there, you’re already in Soho, and I found the place. They told me the classes didn’t start until 6, but it was only 4:30. So I decided to go for a walk; I reached Chinatown and found a doctor. I asked for a foot reflexology massage, which came in incredibly handy.

When I came out, it was pouring with rain, but it stopped after 10 or 15 minutes. The guy wanted me to get another massage while I waited. I arrived at the bar and had to wait an hour; there were some guys filming a scene for a movie or a series. Very strange. Very amateur. When it started, I signed up for bachata and salsa. It was a lot of fun, and I met a couple of very interesting girls, but when it ended, I didn’t say anything to them. Since it was already late and I was tired, I decided to go back to the hostel, as tomorrow I have to catch a flight to Bilbao and start the Apapacho Fest. I’m thinking that depending on how tomorrow goes, I might take a few days off from writing and resume on the 10th when I start the Camino—or maybe not, we’ll see.

Anyway, for dinner I wasn’t very sure what to do, and in the end I chose the healthy option: fruit, hard-boiled eggs, and a red berry smoothie. Oh! When I came out of the Tottenham metro station, I came across a building where, inside, there were projections on the walls and ceiling—really cool visuals with music, a mind-blowing sensory experience. You could see people standing there watching, and kids totally amazed. In the end, I left, but I could have stayed much longer. Oh! And after leaving the dance class, I no longer had any back pain; I think I really needed to move my skeleton, and foot massages work miracles. I think that sums up the day pretty well. Good night.
