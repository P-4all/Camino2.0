# Not too much

[Index](../index.md)

## Saturday 2nd of August 

It’s 10:05 p.m.; I’m at the hostel, where I’ve spent most of the day. As I promised, I’ve taken it easy. I woke up around 10 in the morning. I did my practice with the audios I had recorded. The headphones worked well for me, and so did the earplugs. I listened to the teachings for the corresponding topic, from which I’d highlight that rather than giving, one should offer, and that the other perfections should always be taken into account. Anyway, I don’t want to mix reflections.

After deciding where to go for breakfast, I searched for a place on Google, but it turned out to be a failure: the place was empty—it no longer existed.

In any case, I went for a walk around the neighbourhood and discovered a street market selling a bit of everything. I was surprised to see fruit much cheaper than at the Notting Hill market, although I also have to say that the produce was of lower quality. After walking around, I decided to have breakfast at a standard place, a café.

I had a big English breakfast with a spinach smoothie—everything was very green. A man even asked me what I was drinking. Afterwards, I was so full that I went back to the hostel to take a nap. During the nap, some new people came in, making a lot of noise, and when a girl saw me she got scared and spilled—I don’t know what drink—on the floor. It seems she panicked.

After a while, I spoke with my mother, and she told me about things she had posted on Facebook and big news: during Ana’s trip to the Maldives, her boyfriend proposed to her, so maybe we’re going to a wedding… or maybe not.

Later, I went back out, bought some water at Sainsbury’s, and walked around the neighbourhood a bit more. I came across some police officers who had parked in a small nearby square. There was also a very small park with painted elephants (sculptures). I went back to the hostel and, to my surprise, there were two police officers with a woman. I think she had lost her luggage or it had been stolen.

After that, I went out for dinner at a ramen place. I’m having dinner and listening to music. I thought it was some kind of live music concert, but it was actually groups of Latinos with speakers (it seems to be a Latino neighbourhood). To finish off, I returned to the hostel and mended my backpack, which had another hole.
