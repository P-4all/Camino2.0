# The Nature of Being and Other Phenomena

[index](../index.md)

## Wednesday 6^th August

It’s 11:15 p.m. I’m in the phone charging area under the big palm tree in the middle of the garden, between the road and the river. I don’t use my phone much, but it’s at fifty-two percent now; if I manage to charge it fully, I probably won’t need to charge it again.

I’ve just come back from tonight’s show, Ángel Rielo, a comedian who isn’t bad at all, but I’m a bit tired and feel more like laughing than going out partying.

Today I’ve met a lot of super interesting people. Since I haven’t explained anything yet about the group dynamics, I’ll start from the first day—or rather, the first night.

A coach arrived late and we had to wait a long time for dinner to be served. Today I found out that the chairs for the outdoor dining area also arrived late.

The food in general is quite good and there’s a variety of options; the only downside, if I have to mention one, is the long queues.

After dinner, there was the first icebreaker dynamic. They took us to the outdoor hall. We took off our shoes and walked very slowly around the space, mixing with one another. I don’t remember it perfectly, but first we had to observe ourselves and then observe others. You would cross faces and gazes, and you had to choose someone to do an exercise with. I don’t remember it clearly, but there was a girl whose gaze and the way she smiled at me I really liked. Honestly, she wasn’t unattractive at all, but (there always has to be a “but”) she has a mark on her upper lip that actually makes her even more attractive—though I don’t think she’s my type. (There goes one of my bad habits: looking for excuses when women show interest in me.) Is it fear? Why am I so demanding? No wonder things go the way they do.

In the same dynamic or therapy session, we gathered with several people and in the end we didn’t form just two pairs; we did very fun exercises, especially involving dance. Two other girls stood out: one who has “something about her,” and another whose name I don’t remember, a bit older than me.

The first night in the tent was very humid; the tent they gave us leaked so much that it was wet inside. Despite that, I slept well.

The next morning I went to the yoga class, which felt a bit strange at first but then turned out well.

Afterwards I showered and bathed in the spa pool, and I really liked the breakfast too—my tea, porridge, and fruit. It helps with my digestion. The morning dynamic was the festival presentation, led by the organizer. He told us he had lived on the streets for 14 years and then met his co-partner, and together they created these festivals. Afterwards they threw balloons into the crowd, and inside were messages like Chinese fortune cookies. Mine said something like: “Tenderness is the foundation of love.” Other people got discounts for paid therapies or merchandising products.

Lunch was good too, and the afternoon dynamic was really cool. It was about rejection and boundaries. There I connected with some very beautiful people, but it was hard to accept rejection because you had to say “NO” three times before you were allowed to say “YES” when someone asked you to be their partner for the exercise. The second time I asked a pretty girl with a great body but a slightly unusual face—she reminded me of Chantal, my French boss. The exercise about giving, taking, and receiving really resonated with me; it reminded me of the exercises I used to do with my ex-partner in sexuality therapy. In this case, the forbidden zones were the arms and the head. It was very interesting.

At night we had the cacao ceremony. Absolutely wild. I gave it my all, and when I shouted, I could feel my vocal cords tightening; that’s why today I’m hoarse. Luckily it doesn’t hurt when I swallow.

It rained all night and the tents flooded. Before I continue with that, I have to say that the singer in the cacao group is Venezuelan—absolutely gorgeous. If I were 17, I’d say I’ve fallen in love. I had already seen her walking alone in the gardens; I thought she was just another participant. That reminds me of a chance encounter by one of the trash bins in the outdoor dining area with another stunning girl, very similar to that singer. She’s from Zaragoza and has a super difficult name. We talked a bit about I don’t even remember what. I told her about the nature of our being—like drops of water on a windowpane, individual, each with different shapes and sizes, yet all of the same essence. That’s how living beings are: at first glance we seem independent from one another, but we share so much in common.

If, when I look into someone else’s eyes, I see my own being reflected, does that mean my being is living infinite lives at this very moment?

Anyway, when the cacao festival ended—super interesting—I gave it one hundred percent. When I returned to the tent, everything was soaked. Luckily, the organizers let us use the yoga hall to spend the night and rest properly.

For that reason, there was no yoga today, so I went to a stone training session instead. Super intense. After giving it my all, when we sat down to meditate, my body became so relaxed that I stayed in meditation for quite a while. I don’t know exactly how long, but at least 30 minutes, and my mind felt very comfortable and calm.

When I walked to breakfast, I was moving so slowly because of leg pain that it took me ages. I think I’ll repeat the training on Friday.

Breakfast in the indoor dining area was very good too—porridge, tea, and fruit—but without such long queues. I couldn’t shower because my towel was wet.

The morning dynamic was about love and sexuality. Super powerful as well. I was able to heal wounds, traumas, and resentments I had toward my father and childhood friends—all by looking deeply into the eyes of people I didn’t know at all. Very powerful.
